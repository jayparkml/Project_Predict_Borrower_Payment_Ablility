    "# Build a machine learning model that predict borrower's payment ability in Lending Club\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will focus on credit modelling, a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk. Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. You can read more about their marketplace [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/company/about-us)."

    "Each borrower fills out a comprehensive application, providing their past financial history, the reason for the loan, and more. Lending Club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data (and their own data science process!) and assign an interest rate to the borrower. The interest rate is the percent in addition to the requested loan amount the borrower has to pay back."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "A higher interest rate means that the borrower is riskier and more unlikely to pay back the loan while a lower interest rate means that the borrower has a good credit history is more likely to pay back the loan. The interest rates range from 5.32% all the way to 30.99% and each borrower is given a grade according to the interest rate they were assigned. If the borrower accepts the interest rate, then the loan is listed on the Lending Club marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors are primarily interested in receiving a return on their investments. Approved loans are listed on the Lending Club website, where qualified investors can browse recently approved loans, the borrower's credit score, the purpose for the loan, and other information from the application. Once they're ready to back a loan, they select the amount of money they want to fund. Once a loan's requested amount is fully funded, the borrower receives the money they requested minus the origination fee that Lending Club charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The borrower then makes monthly payments back to Lending Club either over 36 months or over 60 months. Lending Club redistributes these payments to the investors. This means that investors don't have to wait until the full amount is paid off before they see a return in money. If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return which corresponds to the interest rate the borrower had to pay in addition to the requested amount. Many loans aren't completely paid off on time, however, and some borrowers default on the loan."

In this course, we'll focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time. To do that, we'll need to first understand the features in the dataset and then experiment with building machine learning models that reliably predict if a loan will be paid off or not."

    "From the investor's perspective, we're interested in trying to predict which loans will be paid off on time and which ones won't be. Only the Fully Paid and Charged Off values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still ongoing and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the Default status resembles the Charged Off status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance. Since we're interested in being able to predict which of these 2 values a loan will fall under, we can treat the problem as a *binary classification* one. Let's remove all the loans that don't contain either Fully Paid and Charged Off as the loan's status and then transform the Fully Paid values to 1 for the positive case and the Charged Off values to 0 for the negative case."

With a false negative, we predict that a loan won't be paid off on time, but it actually would be paid off on time. This loses us potential money, since we didn't fund a loan that actually would have been paid off. Since we're viewing this problem from the standpoint of a conservative investor, we need to treat false positives differently than false negatives.

    "Ultimately, our best model had a false positive rate of nearly 8%, and a true positive rate of nearly 18%. For a conservative investor, this means that they make money as long as the interest rate is high enough to offset the losses from 8% of borrowers defaulting, and that the pool of 18% of borrowers is large enough to make enough interest money to offset the losses.\n",

    "- We can tweak the penalties further.\n",
    "- We can try models other than a random forest and logistic regression.\n",
    "- We can use some of the columns we discarded to generate better features.\n",
